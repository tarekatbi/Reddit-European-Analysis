      "After all, in WW2, Germany did want to invade us. The only reason they did not was because they had their hands full at the time (and that they wouldn't have enough gains by invading us anyway).  \n",

      "Now there is the other weird point of view where not helping Ukraine is considered being for Russia.

In this situation the yellow one is entering the roundabout before it cross the red one, so at this point they both at the roundabout, so the priority based on the signs is not applied anymore. Let's take a look at horizontal signs, p-8. So based on the other entries we can spot that you can go straight from every line (it's clearly visible at the bottom entrance). So the yellow one can enter the roundabout from this lane and go straight. So, what's about this situation? The right hand rule. The yellow and the red are simply crossing the equivalent intersection. The yellow is on the right side for the red one, so the red one shoul give way to the yellow one. In the same situation of road collision in my hometown, the red one got a ticket and penalty points.\n",

I have a question/worry that I would appreciate some clarity around: My application was recently submitted by an immigration agency in person at the SUA in Oslo, we will be waiting for the decision before I fly to Oslo. Based on the increasing coronavirus cases throughout Europe (albeit low death rate), what are the chances Norway might re-introduce border restrictions and I won't be able to fly in? Also, once they approve my application all I will get is a letter saying I am good to fly into Norway, would this be enough to show at my port of entry when flying into Schengen? I am from a Schengen visa-free country but I know Europe currently is only open to a very select list of countries, and as I won't have an official residence permit or visa I fear I might be turned down. Many thanks in advance for any help!\n",

As for cars, some streets are steep and canted where they meet a cross road, so unless you have an SUV, you'll bottom out the bottom of your car and it's super annoying.

      "\n",
      "‘Er zit meer achter deze poort”, verscheen deze zomer in witte koeienletters op de blauwe schuifpoort van de PI Vught om mensen lekker te maken voor werk in het gevangeniswezen. „Aan de bak in de bak”, luidde de slogan op een groot bord bij de gevangenis in Lelystad.\n",
      "\n",
      "De wervingsacties sorteerden niet het gewenste effect. Een maand geleden maakte demissionair minister voor Rechtsbescherming Franc Weerwind (D66) bekend dat het vanwege personeelstekorten niet meer lukt om alle tot celstraf veroordeelde criminelen ook daadwerkelijk op te sluiten. Tijdelijk worden daarom geen zelfmelders (veroordeelden die het ondergaan van hun gevangenisstraf in vrijheid mogen afwachten) meer opgeroepen. Tot eind maart gaat het volgens het ministerie om 670 personen. En als het aan de Weerwind ligt volgen spoedig nóg drastischer maatregelen, namelijk dat tot maximaal 1 jaar celstraf veroordeelde criminelen hun straf deels thuis mogen uitzitten – met een enkelband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Het leidt tot afkeurende reacties. De Raad voor de rechtspraak benadrukt dat rechters weloverwogen tot een straf komen en dat die opgelegde straf vervolgens ook ten uitvoer gelegd dient te worden. „Als gemorreld wordt aan de beslissing van de rechter, dan kan dat het gezag en de geloofwaardigheid van de rechtspraak beschadigen”, zei voorzitter Henk Naves onlangs in NRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ook Slachtofferhulp Nederland toont zich not amused. Het noemt het enkelbandplan desgevraagd oneerlijk en pijnlijk voor de slachtoffers die ervan uitgaan dat een dader daadwerkelijk de straf ondergaat die door de rechter is opgelegd.\n",

      "Dat, zoals minister Weerwind de Tweede Kamer schrijft, de Nederlandse arbeidsmarkt met „ongekende krapte” kampt en de Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen (DJI) daar de gevolgen van ondervindt, is maar een deel van het verhaal. De personeelstekorten bij DJI, die ’s lands 29 penitentiaire inrichtingen en tien jeugdgevangenissen runt, spelen namelijk al vele jaren.\n",
      "\n",
      "„De kiem van de huidige problemen ligt bij het Masterplan dat het kabinet Rutte II ruim tien jaar geleden doorvoerde”, vertelt FNV-vakbondsbestuurder David Schreuders. Als onderdeel van brede bezuinigingen, waarbij de gehele justitieketen moest inleveren, moesten [negentien gevangenissen dicht](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/06/19/zeven-extra-gevangenissen-blijven-open-a1433842). Het leidde bij DJI tot een uittocht van ervaren personeel. Ondertussen steeg de werkdruk, niet in de laatste plaats omdat het aantal gedetineerden na jaren van dalingen de afgelopen jaren juist weer toeneemt door hogere straffen. Dit jaar telde Nederland gemiddeld zo’n 9.000 gedetineerden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vakbond FNV sloeg veelvuldig alarm over de personeelstekorten bij DJI (17.000 medewerkers; 15.796 fte) en de daardoor veroorzaakte hoge werkdruk. Na alarmerend FNV-onderzoek in 2017 werd nog vol goede moed het convenant „Werken aan een solide personeelsbeleid” met DJI getekend. Maar wezenlijke verbetering bleef uit. De vakbond bracht in 2020 het rapport Code Rood uit. Daarin wordt geschetst dat door de hoge werkdruk de veiligheid van werknemers en gedetineerden steeds meer onder druk komt te staan. Ook dat leidde niet tot verbetering en deze zomer luidde FNV na een enquête onder ruim 700 DJI-medewerkers opnieuw de noodklok. Nu omdat personeel aangeeft dat de werkdruk nóg meer is toegenomen, zij zich onveilig voelen en hun werk niet meer goed kunnen doen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Al jaren ligt het aantal openstaande vacatures bij DJI tegen de duizend. Het resultaat van wervingscampagnes is verwaarloosbaar omdat personeel ook massaal de gevangenispoort achter zich dichttrekt. De afgelopen drie jaar steeg de jaarlijkse uitstroom met vijftig procent naar ruim 1.600 medewerkers per jaar, blijkt uit cijfers van het ministerie. Tegelijkertijd nam het ziekteverzuim een flinke vlucht naar 8,7 procent: ruim 40 procent boven het gemiddelde dat het CBS voor soortgelijke beveiligingsberoepen (waaronder de politie) noteert.\n",
      "\n",
      "„Ik heb collega’s die denken: ‘Ik ga lekker op Schiphol als beveiliger werken, daar heb ik dezelfde arbeidsvoorwaarden, dus waarom zou ik in de bajes werken en iedere dag bedreigd en uitgescholden worden en doodmoe thuiskomen?’”, vertelt een DJI-medewerker van de PI Zaanstad. Hij wil, net zoals de andere DJI-medewerkers die NRC sprak, niet met zijn naam in de krant uit vrees voor repercussies van de leiding. De man licht toe hoe de werkdruk de afgelopen jaren alleen maar hoger is geworden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ter illustratie wijst hij op de dagelijkse dienstlijst die standaard vol ‘rode lijnen’ staat: locaties in de gevangenis waar beveiligers tekortkomen. De oude norm van 1 cipier op 12 gedetineerden is al lang losgelaten. Maar ook de nieuwe norm van 3 cipiers op 48 gevangenen wordt niet gehaald. In de praktijk staan daarom vaak maar 2 beveiligers op 48 gedetineerden en laat de dienstlijst een rode lijn zien.\n",
      "\n",
      "Van hogerhand krijgen bewakers te horen dat zij als ze die bezetting onveilig vinden ervoor kunnen kiezen niet ‘open’ te gaan, de gedetineerden op hun cel kunnen laten en het dagprogramma overslaan. Maar volgens de DJI’er is dat geen optie. „Als ik niet open ga, dan weten 48 mannen dat ik hun dag verpest heb. Die keus kan ik niet maken, want ik moet elke dag met ze werken”, zegt de man die elke keer „met loodzware schoenen” naar zijn werk gaat. Zijn schets komt overeen met die van een collega uit dezelfde inrichting die NRC afzonderlijk sprak.\n",

      "Het is vrij lastig om gekwalificeerde mensen te vinden en dat geldt extra voor een lastige werkomgeving als een gevangenis. Dat zou in elk geval niet mijn eerste keus zijn. En dus moet er duidelijk iets geboden worden. Op zijn minst een goed salaris. \n",

Tikrai žinau, kad vairavo vienerių metų senumo Škoda automobilį, bet tas buvo per prastas, tai pardavė ir nusipirko apynaujį Audi Q7. Iš kunigo \"algos\". Kiek vėliau dar tą savo knygą visais būdais stūmė ant pardavimo. Dar labai moralizuodavo, kad reikia nedaryt nuodėmių ir gyvent pagal Dievo žodį, bet iš pažįstamų gėjų girdėjau, kad \"čiulpia net pasičepsėdamas\", ir kad būdavo gan dažnas svečas privačiuose vakarėliuose.

From there, Kandji does all of the security settings, application installs, and anything else that needs configured. Intune does it when the user logs in. The advantage to using an MDM system, is that it will keep the OS and applications updated as needed. I can also remotely lock machines for off-boarding. It also allows me to manage rollout of new applications, new settings, fonts, etc...  Apple has a system that tracks serial numbers, so they will auto activate. I can ship a new unopened laptop, and as soon as they start it up, it automatically connects to our system and configures itself.  Intune isn't as sophisticated or easy to use, but overall has similar features. It completely removes the need for keeping an image updated, and moves to a model where all endpoints are actively manages. We moved from Sentinel One to Crowdstrike, and it took us a total of 5 hours to test, configure, and roll out on 150 machines. It also makes support easier. If a machine is having issues, I can remotely talk or provide documentation to a user on how to wipe and reload the OS, the system does all of the rebuilding.\n",

We don’t intervene because of the threat of nuclear war. A drip-feed method wouldn’t work here, and neither would sending large amounts of equipment. \n",
      "3.\t⁠5-6 years later, they begin to engage in hybrid warfare against the Baltics, combined with a massive misinformation campaign far bigger than anything we’ve seen before. They denounce the Baltics as Russophobic, uncivilised Nazis. Massive numbers of immigrants are pressed against the Baltic border, promised by Russia that they will be given asylum (they’ve used these methods before). The Baltics build walls, but the Russian state actually builds ramps to help the immigrants get over the walls. Either the Baltics shoot these immigrants (who are guilty of nothing more than believing the lies that they will be given asylum) - in which case the videos will be plastered everywhere- or the border turns to chaos as they try to handle them.\n",

Την \"κοινωφελή εργασία\" οποιοσδήποτε έχει εγκέφαλο την αντικαθιστά με \"εξαναγκαστική εργασία\" στο κεφάλι του και πετάει την φανφάρα της κοινωφέλιας στα σκουπίδια. Το ότι οι φυλακές ήδη βρίσκονται σε τραγική κατατάσταση και με βάση των νέο ΠΚ θα γεμίσουν κι άλλο, έχει δύο πιθανά σενάρια: το πρώτο είναι ότι βασικά μιλάμε για εξόντωση των κρατουμένων σε ήδη άθλειες συνθήκες, και το δεύτερο είναι ότι μιλάμε βασικά για ανάγκη δημιουργίας περισσότερων φυλακών/κέντρων κράτησης. Και λέω εγώ τώρα με το μικρό μου το μυαλό, όλα αυτά σημαίνουν διαγωνισμοί και απευθείας αναθέσεις, σωστά; Γιατί δεν ψηφίζουν και τίποτα για ιδιωτικές φυλακές στην τελική για να έχουν ένα καλό pipeline κέρδους;\n",

      "Il était commandant de bord pour un vol partant de Paris et à destination de l'Afrique du Sud. L'avion, qui allait transporter des passagers, devait également servir de transport pour un cargo assez insolite mais pas inhabituel pour les pilotes : quelques cercueils ainsi qu'un tigre (vivant). Par mesure de protection le tigre était sous sédatif et était entouré d'une double cage. Les cercueils, eux, étaient réfrigérés, afin d'assurer le meilleur état possible pour les corps à l'arrivée (ils devaient être enterrés avec cérémonie en Afrique du Sud), et pour éviter que des odeurs de putréfaction ne parviennent au nez des passagers lors du vol. Le cargo a été chargé la veille du départ et laissé dans la soute pour la nuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le matin (5h du matin à peu près, un dimanche), l'équipe technique intervient sur l'avion, la routine. Sauf qu'à l'ouverture des portes de la soute, les techniciens entendent des bruits sourds qui en émanent et tout à coup voient une patte de tigre passer dans l'interstice de l'ouverture. Ils referment immédiatement la porte sans que le tigre ne puisse sortir, l'équipage de l'avion, la compagnie et l'aéroport sont prévenus. Après délibération ils décident de faire venir un vétérinaire spécialisé en animaux de ce type afin d'endormir la bête et de la replacer dans sa cage. Problème: il est interdit en France de faire pénétrer des armes sur un aéroport (sauf l'armée je suppose) et le fusil à fléchettes sédatives en est une. Le seul moyen est d'obtenir une dérogation de la part du préfet (pour rappel il est dimanche vers 5-6h du matin).\n",
      "\n",
      "Heureusement, au bout d'un certain temps le préfet est réveillé, signe la dérogation et le tigre est endormi sans gros souci. L'équipage entre alors dans la soute et découvre que le félin avait réussi à forcer sa cage, probablement excité et énervé par l'odeur émanant des cercueils. Je l'ai dit plus haut, ces derniers étaient réfrigérés pour entre autres qu'un humain ne puisse pas en sentir l'odeur. L'odorat des tigres étant beaucoup plus développé que le nôtre, l'animal avait dû avoir les naseaux remplis de fragrance de viande fraîche. Cela lui avait donc donné l'énergie de se libérer et de commencer à croquer quelques morceaux dans certains cercueils (pas le repos éternel qu'ils s'imaginaient). Et puis, on connaît tous les dégâts qu'un chat seul dans un appartement peut faire, alors imaginez un peu ceux d'un tigre énervé...\n",

Jeg vil ikke kede jer med det, men jeg frygtede, at det skulle være sådan resten af mit liv. Det gør jeg ikke længere. For nogle måneder siden begyndte det at lysne. Angsten fyldte mindre, og bekymringerne blev lettere at lægge til side. Så faldt jeg over et opslag om, at livet er inddelt i perioder af syv år. Det er sikkert ikke faktabaseret viden, men det passer faktisk meget godt, at jeg har været urimeligt bange (uden reelt at have noget at være bange for) i syv år.

To jsme zpozorněli - přeci jen jezírková folie se dává do vody a osb desky tam obvykle nejsou. A co myslíte, on ji použil na střechu zahradního domku.

Ja sam se pobunio bio, ali problem za njih je bio sto sam bio jako dobar u ovom poslu, gdje sam u dvije godine naucio i da radim za masinom, i da razumijem tzv g-code masine, i bio sam medju najboljim. Pa kad sam se pobunio, nisu mi nista uradili, ali su me poprijeko gledali. I tu subotu nismo radili, a onda su skontali da ne smiju tako popustati pa su nam svima odrzali bukvicu kako se vise ne smijemo zaliti i da \"ko god nije zadovoljan eno mu kapija\".

E sad, slijedi onaj nepopularan zakljucak: Dok god budale prihvataju da budu servilni, da budu ovce, da budu ono tzv \"topovsko meso\", da se radi s njima sta drugi hoce, to po meni znaci da oni to i zasluzuju. Nemaju neki kognitivno-racionalni kapacitet za vise i zasluzuju da budu kao ovce u toru. Tu iskljucujem ljude koji imaju porodice, zenu, djecu, pa to moraju istrpjeti radi te svoje porodice. Razumijem da su oni prisiljeni. Ovo nepopularno misljenje se odnosi na mladje ljude, koji imaju izbora da napuste takva radna mjesta, da se pobune, da odu u drugu drzavu i sl.

      "To me, our neutrality is mostly useful to those waging war around us, to those being the opposite of peaceful, since we essentially are people they don't need to worry about fighting. Up until they do care and could end up invading us anyway once they finished with their other targets, and planned their attack as long as needed since we would never be the first to attack anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, in WW2, Germany did want to invade us. The only reason they did not was because they had their hands full at the time (and that they wouldn't have enough gains by invading us anyway).  \n",

      "\n",

      "Now there is the other weird point of view where not helping Ukraine is considered being for Russia.

      "\n",
      ">According to its figures, 350 tonnes of fur arrive in Switzerland every year, half of it from China “where animal abuse is a daily occurrence”. For foie gras, imports reach 200 tonnes, for a product that requires “the force-feeding of hundreds of thousands of animals”.\n",

      "\n",
      ">The alliance deplores the fact that “so much suffering is inflicted (on animals) for products that we could do without”. These initiatives “will open up a debate on our inconsistencies”, continued the AAS, for whom “all living beings deserve to be respected and protected”.\n",

Anledningen till att jag undrar är för att jag har hört från två olika personer samma sak om vaccin och läkemedelsföretag. Den ena är 69 år och bor på öland och den ändra är 38 och bor i Malmö, de är av motsatt kön och har noll gemensamt förutom speciella åsikter. Finner detta väldigt märkligt och gör mig nyfiken och fundersam. Tydligen har Pfizer skickat en person till Amazonas djungel för längesen när de upptäckte att urbefolkningen kunde hela sig själva med hjälp av ”naturliga läkemedel”. Denna Pfizer representant hade dock tydligen betett sig som ett svin och börjat experimentera med giftiga ormar och grodor trots urbefolkningens goda råd att låta bli. Spola framåt och så kom Pfizer till typ, genom ondska och livsfarliga experiment. Denna historia hörde jag från båda dessa personer med bara någon veckas mellanrum, de måste alltså ha samma källa.

Ali, drzava nema (tjst. ne ume da napravi) drugi izvor prihoda osim da uzima po malo/puno od svakog i tako da opstaje. Mnogo bi bolje bilo da je drzava dobrim upravljanjem od EPSa, Poste, MTSa, fabrika oruzija, NISa, AirSerbia-e itd. napravila profitabilne firme koje ne samo da bi punile kasu direktno nego bi i omogucile dosta poslova i prometa za manje privatne podizvodjacke firme (koje bi radile legalno preko tendera naravno) a uz to bi mogle da daju konkurentne i dobre plate zaposlenima cime bi automatski i privatne firme morale da se prilagodjavaju i tako bi rastao i standard u zemlji, postepeno.

      "Svojevremeno je u periodu od oko 2002 do 2005. godine, cini mi se, bio ukinut porez na kompjutere kako bi se narod sto vise digitalno opremio, da tako kazem. I bila je dobra ideja, u to vreme sam radio malo sa kompjuterskom opremom, to je dosta pokrenulo posao, mada je vec bila jagma za opremom. Posle je taj porez valjda vracen na 8%, pa na standardnu tarifu.\n",

Problem je monopol, ako cemo iskreno i sto nam je trziste u svim oblastima malo.

In this situation the yellow one is entering the roundabout before it cross the red one, so at this point they both at the roundabout, so the priority based on the signs is not applied anymore. Let's take a look at horizontal signs, p-8. So based on the other entries we can spot that you can go straight from every line (it's clearly visible at the bottom entrance). So the yellow one can enter the roundabout from this lane and go straight. So, what's about this situation? The right hand rule. The yellow and the red are simply crossing the equivalent intersection. The yellow is on the right side for the red one, so the red one shoul give way to the yellow one.

I have a question/worry that I would appreciate some clarity around: My application was recently submitted by an immigration agency in person at the SUA in Oslo, we will be waiting for the decision before I fly to Oslo. Based on the increasing coronavirus cases throughout Europe (albeit low death rate), what are the chances Norway might re-introduce border restrictions and I won't be able to fly in? Also, once they approve my application all I will get is a letter saying I am good to fly into Norway, would this be enough to show at my port of entry when flying into Schengen? I am from a Schengen visa-free country but I know Europe currently is only open to a very select list of countries, and as I won't have an official residence permit or visa I fear I might be turned down. Many thanks in advance for any help!\n",

      "****************\n",
      "I can speak on these exact two cities:  Tromso is small, but aside from the city boundary, it feels bigger because of the Kommune being so big, then you have Finland and Sweden nearby.  If you're an outdoors person that wants more adventure to the hiking or whatever outdoors sports, Tromso is it, but I would not really want to live in the city, but on any of the peninsulae nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll also hate the tourist ships because it noticeably gets overrun by tourists.  IMO, Tromso is a much better place when it comes to racism, intolerance, and misogyny, or they hide it better, but be forewarned that Norwegians have a rep for being cold, something like Zuercher.  I don't have an issue in Tromso and the surrounding area making friends, but YMMV.  The Swiss are highly politicized, it's true, and that bleeds into daily things and interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we're talking outdoors, you have to understand the differences, with CH having higher mountains, mountain biking, different wintersports.  That region of Norway has high, but not crazy high mountains like in the Alps, though it has the Lyngenalps nearby that's a very good substitute.  It's not high, but there is technicality to it and endless trails, plus world-class touring skiing trails, backcountry snowboarding and skiing over the fjords, snowshoeing, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city itself is ok for biking.  Compared to Zurich and neighboring places in Germany, France, Italy, and Austria, it might get a 5/10.  You will have to prep for winters on a bike.  People do it, but it sucks.  The city is so small anyhow.  Biking in surrounding areas is not good at all.  Always wear a reflective vest.  As for cars, some streets are steep and canted where they meet a cross road, so unless you have an SUV, you'll bottom out the bottom of your car and it's super annoying.  Housing is so so, people complain about expense and availability.  I think people keep their dogs leashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it will be a different experience, but I find Norway and that region to be more \"in sync\" with the EU than CH is.  That area is actually my base and it leaves a world open to me from northern Sweden and Finland to the Lofoten Islands.  That's just me, though, as I'm into outdoor sports.  I'm an extrovert and had no issues, though I like a balance to keep to myself.\n",

Jo laikas praėjo, atsirado Doveika. Irgi jaunas, vadovavo katedrai, buvo pakankamai modernių pažiūrų (kaip tuo laiku, palyginus su kitais kunigais aplinkui). Realiai nežinau tikrų priežasčių, kodėl jis iškilo. Po to jį \"žvaigždės\" vietoje pakeitė Toliatas - irgi jaunas, knygas rašo. Nežinau, kada ir kodėl jis iškilo, teliko tiek nežiūriu, tik pastebėjau, kad jau apie jį visi kalba, ir šou verslo atstovai pas jį tuokiasi ir vaikus krikštija.

Pasirodė kaip labai nemalonus ir didelis materialistas. Stavkė už vestuves būdavo 400-600 litų, o tų vestuvių per savaitgalį būdavo nuo 6 iki 10. Tikrai žinau, kad vairavo vienerių metų senumo Škoda automobilį, bet tas buvo per prastas, tai pardavė ir nusipirko apynaujį Audi Q7. Iš kunigo \"algos\". Kiek vėliau dar tą savo knygą visais būdais stūmė ant pardavimo. Dar labai moralizuodavo, kad reikia nedaryt nuodėmių ir gyvent pagal Dievo žodį, bet iš pažįstamų gėjų girdėjau, kad \"čiulpia net pasičepsėdamas\", ir kad būdavo gan dažnas svečas privačiuose vakarėliuose.

The advantage to using an MDM system, is that it will keep the OS and applications updated as needed. I can also remotely lock machines for off-boarding. It also allows me to manage rollout of new applications, new settings, fonts, etc...  Apple has a system that tracks serial numbers, so they will auto activate. I can ship a new unopened laptop, and as soon as they start it up, it automatically connects to our system and configures itself.  Intune isn't as sophisticated or easy to use, but overall has similar features. It completely removes the need for keeping an image updated, and moves to a model where all endpoints are actively manages. We moved from Sentinel One to Crowdstrike, and it took us a total of 5 hours to test, configure, and roll out on 150 machines. It also makes support easier. If a machine is having issues, I can remotely talk or provide documentation to a user on how to wipe and reload the OS, the system does all of the rebuilding.\n",

      "2.\t⁠Russia repair their army. It will be more capable since Putin is now aware of the corruption that plagued it in Ukraine. They take Moldova - the Moldovan army is basically nothing. We don’t intervene because of the threat of nuclear war. A drip-feed method wouldn’t work here, and neither would sending large amounts of equipment. \n",
      "3.\t⁠5-6 years later, they begin to engage in hybrid warfare against the Baltics, combined with a massive misinformation campaign far bigger than anything we’ve seen before. They denounce the Baltics as Russophobic, uncivilised Nazis. Massive numbers of immigrants are pressed against the Baltic border, promised by Russia that they will be given asylum (they’ve used these methods before). The Baltics build walls, but the Russian state actually builds ramps to help the immigrants get over the walls. Either the Baltics shoot these immigrants (who are guilty of nothing more than believing the lies that they will be given asylum) - in which case the videos will be plastered everywhere- or the border turns to chaos as they try to handle them.\n",

Την \"κοινωφελή εργασία\" οποιοσδήποτε έχει εγκέφαλο την αντικαθιστά με \"εξαναγκαστική εργασία\" στο κεφάλι του και πετάει την φανφάρα της κοινωφέλιας στα σκουπίδια. Το ότι οι φυλακές ήδη βρίσκονται σε τραγική κατατάσταση και με βάση των νέο ΠΚ θα γεμίσουν κι άλλο, έχει δύο πιθανά σενάρια: το πρώτο είναι ότι βασικά μιλάμε για εξόντωση των κρατουμένων σε ήδη άθλειες συνθήκες, και το δεύτερο είναι ότι μιλάμε βασικά για ανάγκη δημιουργίας περισσότερων φυλακών/κέντρων κράτησης. Και λέω εγώ τώρα με το μικρό μου το μυαλό, όλα αυτά σημαίνουν διαγωνισμοί και απευθείας αναθέσεις, σωστά; Γιατί δεν ψηφίζουν και τίποτα για ιδιωτικές φυλακές στην τελική για να έχουν ένα καλό pipeline κέρδους;\n",

Ils se tournent donc vers d'autres modes de financement, comme les dons, ce qui assez courant depuis le Covid et l'explosion des fondations hospitalières.

Mais sur ce cas précis, c'est un peu dommage de le présenter comme si sans dons du public, George-Pompidou ne pourrait pas avoir de prise en charge d'imagerie pour ses patients.

      "\n",
      "Il était commandant de bord pour un vol partant de Paris et à destination de l'Afrique du Sud. L'avion, qui allait transporter des passagers, devait également servir de transport pour un cargo assez insolite mais pas inhabituel pour les pilotes : quelques cercueils ainsi qu'un tigre (vivant). Par mesure de protection le tigre était sous sédatif et était entouré d'une double cage. Les cercueils, eux, étaient réfrigérés, afin d'assurer le meilleur état possible pour les corps à l'arrivée (ils devaient être enterrés avec cérémonie en Afrique du Sud), et pour éviter que des odeurs de putréfaction ne parviennent au nez des passagers lors du vol. Le cargo a été chargé la veille du départ et laissé dans la soute pour la nuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le matin (5h du matin à peu près, un dimanche), l'équipe technique intervient sur l'avion, la routine. Sauf qu'à l'ouverture des portes de la soute, les techniciens entendent des bruits sourds qui en émanent et tout à coup voient une patte de tigre passer dans l'interstice de l'ouverture. Ils referment immédiatement la porte sans que le tigre ne puisse sortir, l'équipage de l'avion, la compagnie et l'aéroport sont prévenus. Après délibération ils décident de faire venir un vétérinaire spécialisé en animaux de ce type afin d'endormir la bête et de la replacer dans sa cage. Problème: il est interdit en France de faire pénétrer des armes sur un aéroport (sauf l'armée je suppose) et le fusil à fléchettes sédatives en est une. Le seul moyen est d'obtenir une dérogation de la part du préfet (pour rappel il est dimanche vers 5-6h du matin).\n",
      "\n",
      "Heureusement, au bout d'un certain temps le préfet est réveillé, signe la dérogation et le tigre est endormi sans gros souci. L'équipage entre alors dans la soute et découvre que le félin avait réussi à forcer sa cage, probablement excité et énervé par l'odeur émanant des cercueils. Je l'ai dit plus haut, ces derniers étaient réfrigérés pour entre autres qu'un humain ne puisse pas en sentir l'odeur. L'odorat des tigres étant beaucoup plus développé que le nôtre, l'animal avait dû avoir les naseaux remplis de fragrance de viande fraîche. Cela lui avait donc donné l'énergie de se libérer et de commencer à croquer quelques morceaux dans certains cercueils (pas le repos éternel qu'ils s'imaginaient). Et puis, on connaît tous les dégâts qu'un chat seul dans un appartement peut faire, alors imaginez un peu ceux d'un tigre énervé...\n",

Immédiatement appel pompiers, et c'est la cavalerie qui arrive : 3 camions de pompier avec lances à incendie, deux camions d'ADP avec du sable, deux fourgonettes de gendarmerie. Les pauvres passagers qui ont attendu 50min pour un problème de carburant doivent halluciner.\n",

Ehkki LSV on juba iseenesest varjatud iseloomuga vägivallavorm, siis kristlikes kogudustes saadab seda eriti kõrvulukustav vaikus, sest *kogudus pere siseasjadesse ei sekku*. Sageli saab ohver kuulda, et tema eest palvetatakse, ent vägivaldsest mehest lahutamisele vaadatakse viltu. Osade pastorite ja hingehoidjate seas levib arvamus *et kui sa oled hea naine, siis sa ei saa peksa.* Sest õige naine allub ja õige kristlane andestab.\n",

Pealesunnitud seks on nii mõnelgi pool normaalsus, räägivad mulle murega terapeudid ja tugikeskuste töötajad. Sellele järeldusele jõudis ka vaimulik **Meelis Maikalu** kaitstud EMK Teoloogilise Seminari diplomitöö, kus intervjueeritud hingehoidjad ja vaimulikud kinnitasid, et tihti nõutakse abikaasalt – tavaliselt naiselt – seksuaalvahekorda.

Eripära seisneb selles, et kristlasest mees võib õigustuseks appi võtta piibli ja selle hierarhilised lähtekohad – mees on kõrgemal naisest, taevas on kõrgemal maast, Jumal on kõrgemal kõigest muust.\n",

Laste kasvatamine ja majapidamine oli üleni Ene rida.  \\[---\\] Ükski koguduse liige ei öelnud Enele kunagi: jaa, muidugi lahuta ära!. Öeldi: „Püüa kõigepealt kuidagi kõik variandid läbi proovida. Ole kannatlik.“ Ja veel: „Palvetame su eest, su mehe eest.“\n",

Koguduse liikmest ämmaemand oli inimene, kes andis nimetuse Ene kodus toimunule: vägistamine. \\[--\\]  Kui tihti ta vägistas, küsin. „Mitte eriti sageli,“ vastab Ene. „Kõige hullematel perioodidel… kord nädalas ehk.“\n",

Nikoho to nezajímá protože držej hubu a krok. Jednou jsem se takhle stavil na oběd a pipi si stěžovala že musí splašit babču aby vyzvedla špunty ze školky, protože tu zase bude zadara dřepět do šesti. Tak jsem vyvalil oči a říkám: Zadara? Jakože ty tu pracuješ nad rámec svého platu dobrovolně? A ví o tom šéfová? Nebyla sis stěžovat, třeba že nestíháš protože se objem práce nedá v pracovní době stihnout? No zmíněná šéfová vyvalila oči (zrovna byla s nima v kanclu) a strašně se začla bránit, že je to běžná praxe a že to tak bylo vždycky a blablabla. Jenom jsm pokrčil rameny s tím, že je fajn udělat něco navíc ale když se z občas stane pravidelně tak bych to pravidelně přidal do smlouvy společně s nárůstem finančního ohodnocení, jinak se navíc nekoná.Najednou se ženský do šéfový pustili jak smečka lvic a najednou nikdo přesčas zadarmo nedělá. Lidi si strašně rádi stěžujou a brečej, ale jak to maj jít řešit, tak to vlastně není až tak špatný....\n",

E sad, slijedi onaj nepopularan zakljucak: Dok god budale prihvataju da budu servilni, da budu ovce, da budu ono tzv \"topovsko meso\", da se radi s njima sta drugi hoce, to po meni znaci da oni to i zasluzuju. Nemaju neki kognitivno-racionalni kapacitet za vise i zasluzuju da budu kao ovce u toru. Tu iskljucujem ljude koji imaju porodice, zenu, djecu, pa to moraju istrpjeti radi te svoje porodice. Razumijem da su oni prisiljeni. Ovo nepopularno misljenje se odnosi na mladje ljude, koji imaju izbora da napuste takva radna mjesta, da se pobune, da odu u drugu drzavu i sl. Dakle oni koji nisu vezani moranjem, a ipak ostaju da se s njima radi kako poslodavac hoce. To su u osnovi moderni robovi koji to i zasluzuju da ostanu.\n",

BiH i bez svojih TE ima dovoljne kapacitete u pogledu MW da zadovolji domaće tržište, naročito će se to poboljšati u budućem periodu puštanjem u rad mnogih PV Parkova, vjetroparkova, HE i sl. koji su u jednoj od faza izgradnje trenutno.

      "I'm Belarusian, currently live in Vilnius. Lithuanians can be easily understood, as we, people of Belarus, continue migrating for a better life from the authoritarian regime. Lithuanians worry as they hear more russian language on their streets, especially in Vilnius, but my family and my colleagues learn the language and try to use it outside. Lithuanians also think we are indoctrinated by litvinism ideology and want to occupy Vilnius, which is a ridiculous nonsense (in fact I learned about litvinism from Lithuanian media).\n",
      "Also you must understand that Lithuania is a democracy and people can have and push their own opinion, especially during elections.\n",
      "Personally me and my family do no feel any oppression from natives. A questionnaire from the migration service about your past and your attitude to the war is not severe and can be easily filled, and in my opinion it is not a good tool to find spies (only strong vatniks maybe).\n",
      "I personally would like to be sure that my residence permit (based on Blue Card) will be prolonged without any trouble, and I will be able to buy a flat and later get the Lithuanian passport after passing language tests. But some Belarusian businesses already started relocation (again), as noone wants risks, and this sucks.\n",
      "****************\n",
      "Before Russia's War agains Ukraine - all Belorussians are victims of Lukashenko's regime, we have to help them all. Also educated Belorusian people help our economy. After war - wait, among Belorussians might be some economic migrants and they might support Russia/Lukshenko, there might also be some people who came to our country to spy for them.\n",
      "Also, at first it's like honeymmon phase where everything is great and we love each other, \"thank you for helping us\" etc. but now more and more demands start to apear from belorusians, like \"education in russian language should be given to us in every city we live\", historical disputes about GDL heritage (more and more litvinists start to become louder) and because of that populist polotics choose to \"defend Lithuania\" and these kind of topics start to appear.\n",
      "Don't want to put a blame on only belorusians but when Belorusian oposition member (can't remember the name) is living in Lithuania for 10 years, her temporary permint is about to end and our laws says that you can get permament permit but you need to take lithuanian language exam and her answer is \"I don't know Lithuanian language because Lithuania didn't pay me for my language classes\", many people (ofcourse uneducated nationalists first) feels like we invided her and all she does is asking for more privilleges instead of trying to integrate into our country while living here for 10 years\n",
      "****************\n",
      "Well... Lithuania is discriminating belarussians solely on the base of nationality for a while now. They even introduced some laws to do that.  I dont think they have any credible reasons actually, so usually they are saying something about KGB, which, as they claim, trying to undermine lithuania as a country. This lame excuses pretty funny to read, tbh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if there some demand for this from lithuania population, although some lithuanians are speaking in pretty racist manner, as on this sub, as on some others, where ive seen them claiming \"belarusians are stealing our jobs, rent is higher because of them\" and stuff like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Im thinking that lithuanians are still struggling with soviet mental heritage, and this results in such behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funny fact - while openly discriminating belarussians, lithuanians are often(like in tenths of thousands, they have vias-free entry) visiting Belarus to get cheap fuel, sigaretes  and medicine, thus financing Lukashenko regime.\n",
      "****************\n",
      "> Is there a significant demand from the population to solve \"Belarusian question\" once and for all?\n",
      "\n",
      "The only available \"once and for all\" option is revoking all permits and allowing entry for asylum seekers only. This is not something general population is into, at least currently, because Belarusians are viewed somewhat positively since school desk. On the other hand allowing easy immigration with stable rules is not even an option at all now, because of unstable geopolitical situation and BY state being perceived as enemy. After all, Luka's henchmen are not some devils we can recognize by their horns and tails, and we are not that gullible to believe they won't try to infiltrate among the huge stream of immigrants, which is problematic to check thoroughly. This push and pull approach is just a compromise Lithuania can offer now at most. Ones who fear getting gray hairs from uncertainty and have ability to move to Poland or generally more to the West should just do so.\n",

      "There is currently no clear integration policy and the flow of Belarussian migrants is basically uncontrolled. Not sure which part of society I represent, but I personally support more restrictions and if the Belarussian businesses decide to move out that is their choice as well. Maybe economically it makes sense but culturally I feel absolutely no connection with Belarus and it's people.\n",

      "Almost 20 years of propaganda brainwashing. They are also very upset, that Belarus built nuclear plant, as this was their idea and plan, to build a new one in ingnalina and thus somehow keep their economy running on something other than EU money.

Our ancestors sacrificed a lot during the times of the Armenian Genocide in 1915. They made sure to stay alive so we could be born. For us to marry outside of our race and culture just wouldn't make sense in a way it feels like we're letting our ancestors down and we're not appreciating all they did for us to be here today.\n",
